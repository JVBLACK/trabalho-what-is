            First of all, it is necessary for us to know that the help you give to your mother
            is not child labor, but when this practice prevents the child from helping you to 
            school, to develop your skills. Currently this practice is a serious crime
             in all countries. In Brazil, people can receive up to 4 years in jail for this.

            Child labor is often a cause of poverty, as it makes it difficult for young pe
            ople to learn new skills and blocks their opportunities in the labor market. It
            is usually carried out by someone due to the savings generated, as it is not 
            necessary to pay the small worker, being almost a slave labor.
